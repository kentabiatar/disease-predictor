        - **Climate and health are deeply connected**: Rising humidity or cold snaps can trigger asthma, infections, joint pain, and more.

        - Temperature, humidity, rainfall
        - Gender-specific health patterns
        - Feature importance optimization via gradient boosting

        It then returns a **risk level** for common diseases, helping users make informed decisions.
